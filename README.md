# Reflections on Advent of Code 2022

Having learned web development through a very practical and focused program, this was very challenging to work through. I had not worked with JavaScript to solve these sort of challenges since JavaScript Foundations before the web dev boot camp started.

Ultimately when other commitments came calling pre-Christmas, it was Advent of Code that was set aside and I instead focused on work and family.

That said, I will consider doing Advent of Code again in December 2023.
